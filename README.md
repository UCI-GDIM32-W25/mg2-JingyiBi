# HW2
## Devlog
This plan for MG2 connects directly to the code by using a Spawner (Class) to manage the CoinSpawner (GameObject) in the Unity scene. The SpawnGroup() (Method) creates Coin Prefabs (GameObject) that move toward the player using transform.Translate in the Update() (Method). When a collision is detected, OnTriggerEnter2D (Method) updates the ScoreText (GameObject) via the UI (Class). One major change was randomizing the Y-axis spawn position to ensure the player must move up and down, making the game more engaging. I also had to set the Gravity Scale to 0 on the coin's Rigidbody 2D to prevent it from falling.
